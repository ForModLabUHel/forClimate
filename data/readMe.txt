Moi Francesco, Annikki, ja Mikko,

I finally clean up the data for all of you.
Here are two sets of data with one word document that you already saw in the meeting.

First of all, you can find the general information from the word document including stand id, coordinates (east and north), site type, and plot id 
with thinning information. I am not so sure of the coordinate system I was given. From my previous work with KPL, 
it should be either EPSG:3067 ETRS89 / TM35FIN(E,N) or EPSG:2393 KKJ / Finland Uniform Coordinate System. After I have checked one examples from 
our list for you, I am pretty sure it must be EPSG:3067 ETRS89 / TM35FIN(E,N). Probably, someone else can confirm this.
I have been considering all these stands were thinned from below as Harri informed me.
The plot id that I completed simulations was highlighted with blue, bold style. I will continue to simulate the other stands next week. 
If you proceed beforehand, you can let me know. If I proceed ahead of you, I will let you know. I think we can start simulations with some of unthinned 
and thinned plots from each stand as we discussed with Jari and Annikki in the meeting.

Second, the xlsx files starting with KPL are the original files from DataPuu of Lukenet. I just added the descriptions in the other sheet for your 
understanding. You should get all the information, which you need, from these two KPL files at stand level.

Third, the xlsx files starting with Daesung are the clean and structured files. These were analyzed by me and sourced originally from KPL files I described above. 
Since I already worked to clean up the DataPuu from KPL_* to Daesung_* for our purpose, I assume that you may be able to focus only on the 
Daesung's files for your analysis. As I prepared for you, I hope that it can make you work more easily and conveniently. 
Still, you can work over again from KPL data above if you wish. It's up to you.
Daesung_meta includes stand id, coordinates, site type, and etc.
Daesung_thin includes the thinning intensity by measurement year or age. Just in case, I included three types of criteria about thinning rate: thin.Nr, thin.Gr , thin.Vr. Basically, you can just use thin.Gr which means thinning rate based on stand basal area. 
Daesung_stand includes all the stand information. Just for your reference, I included "KPL_stand MOTTI" sheet, but you can concentrate on "KPL_stand PREBAS"
 sheet only. I guess the variables in "KPL_stand PREBAS" sheet are enough for your purpose.
When you analyze the data with "Daesung_stand" xlsx, be always careful with "compnt" column (tulostusryhma).

Fourth, for your information, I just attached my PPT slides I presented yesterday in the meeting.

Should you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
Wishing my data and descriptions are clear and obvious to you all, see you in the next meeting.

Best regards,

Daesung Lee
